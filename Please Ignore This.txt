The Maker Movement was defined by amateurs assuming the role of experts and experts masquerading as amateurs. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the management of Maker Media itself. Although Maker Media was nominally based in Sebastopol, in the heart of California wine country, this orgasm of Dunning-Kruger management could just have easily been born of Mountain View, Santa Clara, or San Jose. The Maker Movement was the essence of silicon valley, packaged, resold, and finally liquidated when the VC money finally and inevitably ran out.

The Maker Movement was a democratization of expertise. This was a community that stood up and challenged established practices: conventional wisdom said you can’t create a class of consumers who build things for themselves. This is a movement that said my five minutes with a hot glue gun is just as good as your twenty years of experience with industrial adhesives.
