From: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-future-we-make-a-community-conversation-with-dale-tickets-64390363310


Description:
I would like to invite you as a maker and a contributor to the maker community to a conversation about the future of Make: and Maker Faire on Monday night at Circuit Launch. I’m sure you have read the news about Maker Media shutting down. It’s not the end, however, just a transition. There has been a tremendous outpouring of support from the community.


Dan O'Mara and team at Circuit Launch were kind to offer to host a community discussion. Space is limited to 75 Attendees. Please RSVP only if you can make it, we understand it is short notice and there will be more of these town halls in the near future around the Bay Area.


I’d like to keep you informed about these changes and engage you in thinking about how to sustain the maker movement. I look forward to seeing you.


Warmly,


Dale

Introductions for everyone in the room


0:13:08
DALE: So, thank you all for being here. Just trying to give you some background, and then I’d like to ask, ‘where do we go from here, what’s possible.’ I think there’s some question, where ordinary people would like to talk to makers, and I think we were kind of surprised by the answer to that. They [regular people] enjoy the opportunity to have a conversation with makers, ask questions about how they did something, what it was, how it worked, 


00:14:31
DALE: and it sort of gave us a mission of trying to introduce more people to Making on any kind of level, be that crafting areas to robotics or science or anything. It was something to do. It wasn’t something you talked about. And so that’s pretty much the origin point of it. And I think the magazine was a way to share those instructions. There are no delusions that people are out there and doing every single project in it, but it sort of gave people a window into how things worked.


00:15:12
DALE: And when they have their own ideas, they could say, ‘well it’s a little bit like that project… where you could follow the idea there.
So, we’ve been kind of following that as a mission, trying to follow the community of makers, but also to bring more people into it. More people that care about it. 
00:15:45
DALE: And there’s the idea that there’s a consumer culture and that it’s hard, and that you don’t have the time… But there’s the idea that if you have the time, go do it.
00:16:14
DALE: So that’s sort of a backdrop. Make Media started out under O’Reilly Media in Sebastopol where I live, and we worked there for seven or eight years until we had the oppurtunity to spin it out on its own. And I took venture capital. and then as it was taking off, there was the question of how do we make it work?
00:16:47
DALE: But in some ways, it never seemed that this was a venture capital kind of business. There’s a lot of stuff that we gave away. In some ways, the funding model that we had as a business I think that we executed on the mission well but  that didn’t make investors happy. And I’ve been fighting that for quite a while. And to do what we do -- we have 200 maker faires around the world, we have a magazine, we have content, we do things that we wanted to do, how do we preserve that?
00:17:42
DALE: And none of this as an idea really existed, and we did it by giving it a name and bringing people together. And I do think the thing I was most happy for was that we created a community. That you see a common goal, a common connection and i think that’s at the end of the day what I want to preserve and protect for the future. 
00:18:21
DALE: Uh, so, without going into a lot of detail, Maker Faire was a victim of success. The faires were riskier to do and for us we were still a small company. What we’ve seen over the last year and a half is a decline in corporate sponsorship. And the way it kind of works is that corporate sponsorship kind of gave us the budget for the event, and ticket sales kind of pay expenses after it, and if there was a profit we made some, but they’re both pretty volatile.
00:19:04
DALE: But still people came out. We did not have significant dropoff. But we could have. There were some people that said how big should the event be?, So what we have is in a way a scaled back version of previous maker faires but I don’t think anyone was unhappy. I was very happy [unintelligable]
00:19:59: On June 3rd we basically stopped doing business. And, you know, the bank froze our accounts, and we’re making sure everyone is getting paid, so the last month has been legal, you know, financial, and sadly I let the team go.


00:20:36:
And so the reason we’re here today, is that I’m interested…. The assets of Maker Media are now in a new company called Make Community. And the intention is to go forward with that. But my real goal, or how to think about it, is if this should be a non-profit. Some people have said that we should just close the doors and walk away.
